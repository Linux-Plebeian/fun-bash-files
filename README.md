Making some fun things in python

What they do:

Beemovieprompt.py - a command-prompt style program that consists of features that seem like they would be in a PC from the Bee Movie, only accepts numbers as input.

ImBoredSoIMadeAMaze.py - a basic demo for a maze game

ImBoredSoIMadeAMazeButWithKeyboardInputs.py - Same maze as before, uses keyboard inputs rather than on-screen buttons, uses W A S D for up, down, left, right
